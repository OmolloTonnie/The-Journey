Email Server VLANs Router Setup
Cisco Packet Tracer Project â€” Email Server with VLANs & Router Inter-VLAN Communication

Overview
This project represents my first full-scale Cisco Packet Tracer setup â€” a functional email server network integrated with two VLANs connected via a router-on-a-stick configuration.  
Itâ€™s designed to simulate real-world enterprise segmentation and inter-VLAN communication, complete with a working mail service using the domain `mail.com`.

 Network Components
 End Users 4 in VLAN10 and 2 in VLAN20
 1 Router (for inter-VLAN routing)
 2 Switch (configured with VLANs)
 1 Server (configured as Mail Server)
 VLAN 10 â€“ *Sales Department*  
 VLAN 20 â€“ *IT Department*

 Configuration Summary
 VLAN Setup
/ VLAN / Name /  IP Subnet /  Devices  / 
/------/------/------------/----------/ 
/ 10 / sales / 192.168.10.0/24 / PC0, PC1 / PC2 / PC3/ 
/ 20 / IT/ 192.168.20.0/24 / Laptop0/  PC4 / Server0 /

 Router Sub-Interfaces

 Server Setup
- Static IP:`192.168.20.9`
- Services Enabled:
  - DNS  
  - Email  
  Domain:`mail.com`
  Tested communication: in VLAN 10 and VLAN 20 can successfully send and receive mail through the router.

 Verification
âœ… VLAN segmentation working  
âœ… Inter-VLAN routing functional  
âœ… Successful ping tests between VLANs  
âœ… Email service operational across the network
